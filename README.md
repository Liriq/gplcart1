## About ##
GPLCart is an open source e-commerce platform based on the classical LAMP stack (Linux+ Apache+Mysql+PHP). It's a free, simple, modern and extensible solution that allows you to build online shops fast and easy. GplCart is not a fork of an existing software. It's completely unique, made "with blood, sweat and tears" from the scratch.

## Requirements ##

- PHP 5.4+, Mysql 5+, Apache 1+

Also you'll need the following extension enabled:

- OpenSSL
- Mb string
- Mod Rewrite

## Installation ##

**Old school:**

1. Download and extract to your hosting directory all files inside "gplcart" directory
2. Go to `http://yourdomain.com` and follow the instructions

**Composer:**

Clone to `test` directory

    composer create-project gplcart/gplcart test --stability dev --no-interaction

then you can perform full installation:

1. `cd test`
2. `php gplcart install`

In one line: `composer create-project gplcart/gplcart test --stability dev --no-interaction && cd test && php gplcart install`
