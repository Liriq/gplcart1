## About ##
GPLCart is an open source e-commerce platform based on the classical LAMP stack (Linux+ Apache+Mysql+PHP). It's free, simple and extensible solution that allows you to build online shops fast and easy. GplCart is not a fork of an existing software. It's completely unique, made "with blood, sweat and tears" from the scratch.

## Requirements ##

- PHP 5.4+, Mysql 5+, Apache 1+

Also you'll need the following extension enabled:

- PDO
- FileInfo
- SPL
- JSON
- GD
- Mb string
- Mod Rewrite

## Installation ##

GPLCart has some default dependencies (Jquery etc) which should be downloaded separatelly using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org). If you have downloaded GPLCart manually, make sure that all 3-d party libraries are in place by running `composer update`

*The recommended installation process:*

Download files (including dependencies) into `test` directory

    composer create-project gplcart/gplcart test --stability dev --no-interaction

then perform full installation:

1. `cd test`
2. `php gplcart install`

In one line: `composer create-project gplcart/gplcart test --stability dev --no-interaction && cd test && php gplcart install`

## Some key features ##
